# RhoJVM

This could be based on a multitude of targets:
 - LLVM: I believe this has limited virtual machine support, though you can of course just grab code and map it to memory.
 - Cranelift: A nice way of getting used to it and testing it out.
 - Interpreter: Simpler and quite likely a better example of the usage of rhojvm-base
